## Goal of refactoring
This is our first homework assignment named the refactoring project, like it sounds the goal of this project was to take existing code and improve on it. 

One of the things I learned while completing this project is that there are several ways to do the same thing. The goal was to make sure that D.R.Y was followed. Meaning " Do not Repeat Yourself". This was a bit of a challenge as I had to go through the code line by line to see if there was a need for each item. 

The other part of the challenge was making the links work, but once I went back to the basics it was simple as there was some missing code.
